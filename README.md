> _Note that `cairo-zig` is still experimental. Breaking changes will be made before the first stable release. The library is also NOT audited or reviewed for security at the moment. Use at your own risk._

## 📦 Installation

### 📋 Prerequisites

- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

Alternatively, if you have [nix](https://nixos.org/) installed, you can get the full development environment `nix develop`.

## 🔧 Build

```bash
zig build
```

## 🤖 Usage

You can display the help message by running:

```bash
./zig-out/bin/cairo-zig --help
```

```text
cairo-zig
Version: 0.0.1
Author: StarkWare & Contributors

USAGE:
  cairo-zig [OPTIONS]

Cairo Virtual Machine written in Zig.

## 🔤 TODOs

- [ ] Add test coverage (investigate using [kcov](https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov), [code coverage for zig article](https://zig.news/squeek502/code-coverage-for-zig-1dk1)).
- [ ] Benchmark performances.
- [ ] Enable usage as a library.
- [ ] Fuzzing.
- [ ] Differential testing against Cairo VM in Rust.
- [ ] Memory leaks detection (i.e use tools like [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)).
- [ ] Check [Zig style guide](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Style-Guide) and apply it.
- [ ] Create documentation.
